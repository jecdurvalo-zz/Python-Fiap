I am a feminist. And when I looked up the word in the dictionary that day, this is what it said: "Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes."
My great grandmother, from the stories I've heard, was a feminist. 
She ran away from the house of the man she did not want to marry and ended up marrying the man of her choice. 
She refused, she protested, she spoke up whenever she felt she was being deprived of access, of land, that sort of thing.
